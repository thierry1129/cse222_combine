# Summarize Highlights from Prep Material (Technician)

- Spend approximately 10-15 minutes summarizing highlights from the prep material.
- Do ***NOT*** use outside resources except where/when noted.  The answers should be based only on the group's knowledge.
- Be sure to discuss the content with your group and that everyone agrees on the answers.
- Answers can be brief/informal.

***Q1. Explain how Particle's Streams differ from the variables and functions:***
streams are constantly flowed data. And varibles and functions are usually not changing unless we make it to do so.
***Q2. "Promise" objects are one approach to avoiding some of the problems that can occur with callbacks in event driven programming. Explain how promises are somewhat like `if-then` constructs in programming.***
Both promises and if-then constructs allows us to do different actions base on conditions.
Also we can do promises chains, just like nested if-then constructs
***Q3. Explain how promises are *different* from `if-then` constructs in programming.***
promises are objects.
Also we can chain after a failure, but we can't keep process after a failure in a if-then struct.
