# Safety First!

1. ***Safety to people is paramount!!!***
1. Protecting hardware is also important. **Damaged hardware is not grounds for extensions to due dates.  You may have to use a late coupon.   Be sure you have access to an extra Photon and double check wiring before applying power!**

This class works with low-power microcontrollers and electronics.  Although there is little risk to safety:
- Parts may be destroyed if connected improperly. This often happens nearly instantaneously when power is applied, so it's important to:
  - **avoid changing wiring when circuits are powered and to**
  - **review work carefully when changing or adding circuits**.
- Some parts do generate heat. Although seldom hot enough to cause a fire, parts can melt.
- Short circuits can be unpredictable.  We will be powering devices through computer's USB ports, which have hardware protection on the power supply, but there is still some risk of damage due to improper wiring.
- Electronic devices may misbehave when used in unintended ways or outside their operating ranges.
- Think carefully about current and voltage in all circuits (and the impact of current and voltage on all parts of the circuit).


# Each member of the team should read and agree to the following:

## For in-class work, assignments, and studios:
- I will always use parts in the way intended.
- I will double check circuits before applying power.
- I will not leave circuits powered when not attended.

## For your projects (later in the semester):
- I will not allow my project to operate without supervision until the design and implementation have been reviewed by the instructor or a third party approved by the instructor.
- If I use any additional power supplies (something more than a single USB power supply cable to the Photon or a single 4AA battery pack) or interact with higher power devices/appliances, I will:
  - Have my electrical design, mechanical design, and actual wiring reviewed and approved by the instructor (or approved third party) prior to testing it.
  - Thoroughly test my code using simpler hardware (lights, print statements, etc.) and have my code reviewed by the instructor (or approved third party) before testing it on the actual hardware.
- If my project requires interaction with liquids, I will have the project reviewed by the instructor (or approved third party) before testing it with liquids.
- I understand that my grade may be penalized for disregarding the above.
- I am aware that the project is primarily a proof-of-concept and that there are no requirements to use exotic hardware or power supplies.
- As I develop my project I will try to ensure that my work does not pose a healthy or safety to risk to myself or others.  When in doubt, I will seek clarifications about potential risks.

Each member of the team should type their full name in the appropriate slot of the table to acknowledge agreement:
