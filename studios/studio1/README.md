As with Studio 0, insert your answers to the questions in this document where indicated (and in the format requested).

# Part 0: Class policies

You should review all the class policies and post any questions or clarifications via Piazza (as a followup to the Welcome message) by Wednesday, Jan 25.

***Q1.0 Please acknowledge that you will review the class policies and, if necessary, ask for any clarifications by Wed, Jan. 25.  Each person should type their name below to acknowledge this request:***

# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***

A smart shopping cart that keeps track customers online search history and buying history to make recommendations to customers so as to find related products more easily. For example, if a customer searched vacation and hiking boot, the shopping cart will learn that the customer is probably going hiking, so it will recommend hiking appliances such as tent.


## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

A device that improve day to day lives.

daily routine task tracker.

a shoelaces that can change color depending on the steps you walk per day.

a smart device or smart assistant that keeps track of our daily schedule.


## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***
an alarm


a cell phone app that integrates both indoor and outdoor maps.


when next to medicine cabinate, remind all medicine to take

use emojis or colors( from green as good to red as bad) to reflect the performance of daily routines to make our lives healthier.

keep track of the distance you travel.

integrate daily routine with calendar to set up smart reminders to do daily routine activities.

strength: universal, once developed as software, don't need any investment in hardware for now.

weakness: not everything is digitalized. some part relies on human input.


Second idea:  stickers on different devices to keep track of daily intakes.
## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.
good app.
weight sensor at the bottom of bottle to keep track of water intake.
## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

We decided to install some hardwares such as weight sensors to keep track of daily water intake.

Other software ideas:

1. when water intake level is too low, show low level( red color ) on the app's water intake section.

2. allow customers to add custom values to keep track of. Rely on custom input before we are able to develop related hardwares.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

1. Market Potential
2. User Friend
3. Utility


## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

Yes. The customer is happy with our work.

It can be improved by adding more universal fitted hardwares. such as the weight sensor on water bottle and fruit basket can somehow be shared together.


***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***


Yes, the designer's solution is very good.

It is similar to what we have envisioned.

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
  - feasibility,
  - user-friendly
  - Utility

- Things
  - Chair
  - toothbrush
- Services
- Feedback
- Human Actions
- Missions

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***
