# Assignment 3 Questions

Please answer the following questions.  There are no "wrong" answers, but:
  * Some will help us understand your work habits,
  * Some will help us understand your work, and
  * Some may help you identify deficiencies in your work.

***Q1.0 Can you describe any errors or bugs that you found particularly time consuming or challenging?***

***Q1.1 If applicable, were there any special programming techniques or tools you used to assist you with the bugs/challenges in the previous question?***

***Q1.2 Errors/bugs are unavoidable, but in hindsight are there any techniques/approaches that you could have used (but didn't) that would have helped you with the bugs/challenges?***

***Q1.3 Were there any significant misunderstandings (i.e., not a typo) that deterred your progress on this?  If so, can you describe them?***

***Q2 Do you have any suggestions that would help future students with this assignment?***

***Q3.0 If you worked in a group, did you use pair programming?***

***3.1 If you didn't use pair programming, skip to question 3.2.  If you did, in the following table give each person's name and an estimate of the percent of total time they spent as a "driver":***

| Name  |  % of Time as Driver |
|:------|:---------------------|
|  ???  | ???                  |
|  ???  | ???                  |

***Q3.2 If you used pair programming, skip this question.  If you didn't, explain how you divided up the work and how each person contributed:***

***Q4. Assignment Checklist.  Below is a Markdown style Task List. The Tasks correspond to many of the major features of the assignment. Filling in the checklist will help ensure that you have completed many of the major elements of the assignment (although it does not cover every point possible)***

# Assignment 4 Task List

- [ ] Included an up-to-date wiring diagram
- [ ] Included a complete `GarageHardwareProxy.cpp`
- [ ] Included a complete `GarageController.ino`, with cloud-based functionality
- [ ] State machine uses sensor values to find initial state
- [ ] Thoroughly test all paths through your Finite State Machine
- [ ] Updated `Garage.js` to use the JavaScript API to work with hardware rather than simulating garage behavior
- [ ] Verify that `Garage.js` is not directly interacting with the UI
- [ ] Verify that `GarageApp.js` is controlling the UI and not directly interacting with - [ ] Thoroughly tested all UI functionality and features (basic open/close; auto-close support; showing state, including faults; etc.)
- [ ] Tested "reloading" pages to ensure controls are disabled until state is known
- [ ] Tested "reloading" pages to ensure current state values are shown
- [ ] Ensure all code is non blocking
