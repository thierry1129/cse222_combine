***Q1. Review: What is epoch time:***
Number of seconds elapsed since 1970, Jan 1

***Q2. Review: Epoch time is often used for "time stamps" or for "alarms".  Why is it useful and what are its limitations?***
It is universal so everyone experiences the same epoch time. It is useful because it is in a universal format so it is easy to parse. Limited in the sense that you have to parse it, and also it does not go more in depth than seconds.

***Q3. Give a brief summary of what a webhook is and how they are used:***
Is a way for an app to provide other apps with real-time information. A webhook delivers data immediately. They are used when things need to be updated on the go. For example, scheduling systems for city-wide transporation all need to be in sync and need to be immediately notified of schedule changes. Another exmaple would be airport systems.
