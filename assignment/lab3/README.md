Nope. i found it quite difficult without debugging console in photon kit

***Q1.2 Errors/bugs are unavoidable, but in hindsight are there any techniques/approaches that you could have used (but didn't) that would have helped you with the bugs/challenges?***

***Q1.3 Were there any significan misunderstandings (i.e., not a typo) that deterred your progress on this?  If so, can you describe them?***

***Q2 Do you have any suggestions that would help future students with this assignment?***

***Q3.0 If you worked in a group, did you use pair programming?***

***3.1 If you didn't use pair programming, skip to question 3.2.  If you did, in the following table give each person's name and an estimate of the percent of total time they spent as a "driver":***
